## Part 1: Dependency Injection - implementing a Service Container
The service container embraces the "declare once, use everywhere" philosophy, serving as a registry for class bindings and their concrete implementations. It encapsulates the logic of resolving a class and provides a convenient interface for accessing service classes throughout your application without worrying about dependencies.

### The `bind` method
Before you can use the service container you must first define the bindings of container so it knows how to resolve them for you.

### The `singleton` method

### The `resolve` method

### Auto dependency injection
